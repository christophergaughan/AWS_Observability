# üîç AWS MLOps Observability Platform

![AWS Observability Platform](./aws_obsiverse_ML.pdf)

This diagram represents a **production-grade MLOps observability platform** built using AWS-native services and open-source tools. It‚Äôs designed to support **end-to-end transparency**, from experiment tracking all the way to live model monitoring, cost analysis, and alerting.

Whether you're running deep learning models in SageMaker or serving lightweight scikit-learn endpoints in ECS, observability **isn't optional**‚Äîit's what keeps your pipeline *accountable*, *right-sized*, and *resilient under load*.

## Alternate View: Simplified Observability Platform Diagram

![Simplified Observability Architecture](./aws_obsiverse_2.png)

This alternate version presents the same MLOps observability stack but with a **more streamlined layout**, focused on:

- High-level process steps (e.g., *Submit Experiment*, *Train Model*, *Send Alerts*)
- A cleaner top-down hierarchy that prioritizes **function over infrastructure**
- Clear swimlanes for:  
  `Experimentation ‚Üí Training ‚Üí Deployment ‚Üí Monitoring ‚Üí Alerting ‚Üí Tracing ‚Üí DevOps`

### Comparison: Detailed vs. Simplified View

| Feature | `aws_obsiverse_ML_cropped.png` | `aws_obsiverse_2.png` |
|--------|-------------------------------|------------------------|
| **Visual Density** | High ‚Äì full cloud infra view | Moderate ‚Äì cleaner separation of concerns |
| **Best For** | Interviews, system design deep dives | Presentations, stakeholder overviews |
| **Tracing Clarity** | Explicit Lambda ‚Üî API Gateway ‚Üî SageMaker ‚Üî S3 path | More abstracted |
| **CI/CD Integration** | Shows GitHub Actions ‚Üí CodePipeline ‚Üí CDK flow clearly | Lists tools without flow arrows |
| **Alerting Path** | Clearly wired from Model Monitor ‚Üí CloudWatch Alarms ‚Üí SNS | Arrows implied but not as detailed |
| **Stack Fidelity** | Shows real AWS deployment flows | Highlights functional areas more broadly |

Both diagrams communicate the same MLOps principles, but from different altitudes. The first is like a *DevOps war map*‚Äîevery service, every wire. The second is more of a *tactical blueprint*‚Äîclean lanes, easy to present, and easier to grasp if you're not deep in the weeds.

## Why Observability Matters

Let‚Äôs be real: deploying a model is just step one. Without tight observability:
- You don't know if it‚Äôs drifting.
- You can‚Äôt explain it to stakeholders.
- You can't spot cost creep or latency spikes until they bite you.

This platform enables:
- **Metric tracking** (latency, throughput, memory)
- **Drift detection** using SageMaker Model Monitor
- **Cost-aware instance benchmarking**
- **Distributed tracing** across services (Lambda, API Gateway, SageMaker)
- **Live dashboards** that speak to both engineers and decision-makers

## Tools & Services Used

| Category | Services |
|----------|----------|
| **Experiment Tracking** | MLflow, SageMaker Experiments |
| **Model Training** | SageMaker Training Jobs, EKS, ECS |
| **Model Deployment** | SageMaker Real-Time Endpoints |
| **Evaluation & Monitoring** | CloudWatch Logs, CloudWatch Metrics, Model Monitor |
| **Visualization** | Amazon Managed Grafana |
| **Custom Metrics** | Amazon Managed Prometheus |
| **Distributed Tracing** | AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry (ADOT) |
| **CI/CD** | GitHub Actions, CodePipeline, Terraform, AWS CDK |
| **Alerting** | CloudWatch Alarms ‚Üí SNS |

## Rightsizing Inference Workloads

ML inference isn't one-size-fits-all. The platform supports:
- Benchmarking with **SageMaker Inference Recommender**
- Live comparison of instance types for **latency, cost per 1K inferences**, and **throughput**
- Automatic metric collection to guide **horizontal or vertical scaling decisions**

We don‚Äôt play guessing games with GPU usage or pricing. We let the logs talk.

## Component Breakdown

### Experimentation Layer
- Tracks hyperparams, datasets, and versioned artifacts using MLflow or SageMaker Experiments.

### ‚öôTraining & Deployment
- Models are trained in SageMaker or containerized via ECS/EKS.
- Endpoints deployed via SageMaker or rolled out with IaC tools.

### Observability Stack
- CloudWatch logs and metrics monitor request volume, latency, and system health.
- Prometheus scrapes detailed metrics (e.g., GPU utilization, custom counters).
- Grafana visualizes everything in real time‚Äîwhether you‚Äôre an engineer or a PM.

### Alerting
- Model Monitor detects data drift or quality issues.
- CloudWatch Alarms feed into SNS to trigger Slack alerts, emails, or auto-redeploy workflows.

### Distributed Tracing
- OpenTelemetry traces the flow across services‚ÄîLambda, API Gateway, SageMaker, and S3.
- Makes it easy to debug performance bottlenecks in a microservice-heavy architecture.

## Real-World Use Cases

- Clinical AI models deployed to production? You‚Äôll need to prove model integrity over time.
- NLP endpoints getting hit by customer traffic? You want to track request load and latency shifts.
- Budget tight? Grafana + Prometheus + CloudWatch helps you dial in that instance size like a boss.

## Closing Thoughts

I built this diagram to capture the real-world glue that holds enterprise AI together. Not just code‚Äîbut the observability fabric that lets you *see* what‚Äôs happening, *react* before it breaks, and *prove* value to stakeholders.

If you're trying to build ML that actually survives in production, not just a Jupyter notebook ‚Äî this stack is your friend.
